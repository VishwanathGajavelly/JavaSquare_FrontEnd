## JavaSquare_FrontEnd

#### Modifications Made: 
  1. Unlike my previous design where most of the styling was done manually using CSS, for this project I have implemented Twitter Bootstrap, which made my work lot easier and made the website fully responsive.
  2. Implemented Angular.js which aids new features like counting the characters in text-box and limiting them to certain number, hiding or showing the DOM as per user requests.
  3. Quite a lot changed in the design.
#### Todo:
  1. Had to connect to Server and database, which would not be hard as I have already done for my previous design.
  2. Had to add Youtube API to access the youtube videos I upload on my website. Had to add PayPal Api which enables any generous donations. 
  3. Need to create student profiles and pull the data at runtime based on AJAX features.
  4. Many more to come with the time.
